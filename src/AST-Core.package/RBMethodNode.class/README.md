RBMethodNode is the node that that represents AST of a Smalltalk method.

Some properties aren't known to the parser creating this Object. For example, the scope value isn't known by parsing the code but only after doing a
semantic analysis. Likewise the compilation context isn't needed until we try to do the semantic analysis. 

Instance Variables:
	arguments	<SequenceableCollection of: RBVariableNode>	the arguments to the method
	body	<BRSequenceNode>	the body/statements of the method
	nodeReplacements	<Dictionary>	a dictionary of oldNode -> newNode replacements
	replacements	<Collection of: RBStringReplacement>	the collection of string replacements for each node replacement in the parse tree
	selector	<Symbol>	the method name
	keywordsPositions	<IntegerArray | nil>	the positions of the selector keywords
	source	<String>	the source we compiled
	scope	<OCMethodScope | nil> the scope associated with this code of this method
	pragmas	< SequenceableCollection of: RBPragmaNodes > Nodes representing the pragma statements in this method
	compilationContext	<CCompilationContext | CompilationContext>
