Transforms single branch conditionals with multi-statement bodies into a sequence of statements guarded by a conditional return.
For example

[[[ 
foo 
	statements. 
	condition ifTrue: [ statement1. statement2 ]
]]]

is transformed into 

[[[  
foo
	statements.
	condition ifFalse: [^self].
	statement1.
	statement2.
]]]
