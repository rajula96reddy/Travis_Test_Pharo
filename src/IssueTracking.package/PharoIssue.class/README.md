I represent a Pharo development issue.

Responsibilities:
- create text templates (e.g. for the mailing list or issue tracker comments) for common events like issue creation and slice submission
- communicate with the issue tracker

Collaborators:
- ZnClient - my link to the issue tracker
- MCSliceInfo - I can get you one if you need it

Public API and Key Messages:
Most of my behavior is illustrated in my tests. The noticable exception are my text template creation messages, the testing of which seemed to hurt as much in duplication as it added in QA.
