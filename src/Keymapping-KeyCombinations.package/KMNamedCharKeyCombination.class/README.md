Similar to KMUntypeableSingleKeyCombination I am used for special keys that don't only rely on their key character.

The difference to KMUntypeableSingleKeyCombination is that I am
typeable but in shortcut descriptions I use a special name for my character. 

For example, a key combnation for the space key is a KMNamedCharKeyCombination and will be printed as
"Shift + SPACE"
rather than
"Shift +  "
