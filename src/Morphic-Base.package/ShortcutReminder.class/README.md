ShortcutReminder is an object used to bring up a notification whenever a menu entry that has a keyboard shortcut is clicked on instead of using the keyboard.

It is configurable from the settings browser, where one can choose the location and size of the notification Morph. The notification also holds a count of how many times a specific menu entry has been reminded for, and will only notify up to that limit. It is possible to set this limit to -1 such that it will always notify.
