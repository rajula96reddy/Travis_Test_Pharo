I prepare a shortcut as a combination of symbols (the command, alt, etc. symbols... check #symbolTable to have a detail). 
We also trust in the presence of FreeType fonts (a default nowadays) and "Lucida Grande" font, the mac font used to show menus. 

If any of this conditions are not fullfilled, ToggleMenuIttemMorph with not use me but my sibling.
