I create a Nautilus group with all the loaded packages from a configuration inside of it.
Use it by providing the way to get all the necessary informations to access data. See class side.

You can use it through the CatalogBrowser, Versionner or by hand with :

(ConfigurationOfXXX project version: aVersion) loadAndCreateGroupInNautilus
