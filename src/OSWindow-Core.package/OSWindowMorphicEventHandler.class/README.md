I can be used to convert OSWindow-level events to Morphic events.
So, that installing my instance as event handler for specific window would allow running Morphic World in it.

Later, the Morphic can be integrated with OSWindow API to avoid unnecessary conversion and thus eliminating the need in having this class.
