I represent a example expression (expression and value) within a method
comment (RBCommentNode). Every pair of Pharo expression and a separator (default ">>>") can be styled as Pharo code and the editor iconstyler  can highlight the code and evaluate the expression.

Example, within a method comment:

" 3 + 4 >>> 7"

The example code should show an  expression 3 + 4 and the expected value 7.

See setting on "Code Browsing" to enable / disable this doc comment style.
