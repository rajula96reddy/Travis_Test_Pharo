I'm an icon pack who retrieve icons from a remote repository (https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-icon-packs).

You should access this icons using #iconNamed: idiom: 

Smalltalk ui icons iconNamed: #add.

Iuse an override of #doesNotUnderstand: to provide compatibility with "old way" of providing icons: 

Smalltalk ui icon addIcon. 

Installation:
----------------
ThemeIconPack new 
	name: 'idea11';
	loadIconsFromUrl;
	beCurrent.

NOTE: "name" is the branch name in the repository.
