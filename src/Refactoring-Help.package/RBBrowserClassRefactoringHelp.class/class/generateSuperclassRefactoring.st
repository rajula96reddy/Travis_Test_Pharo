		title: 'Generate Superclass'
		contents: 
'
Adds a new superclass between a class and its previous superclass. It offers a check-box list of the subclasses. Every checked element will be moved to be a subclass of the new superclass. That is, subclasses are moved to siblings of its prior superclass. Every instance variable shared by the new siblings will be moved to the new superclass.
The name of the new class needs to be a valid class name, not yet used as any global identifier.
