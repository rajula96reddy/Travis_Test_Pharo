It follows an explanation with some examples, how to manually construct and execute refactoring operations, usable for those operation that aren''t supported as operations in the System Browser or to help to include them in your own tools.

This search capability - search for code "patterns" - can be used to detect common program errors or just bad code style. The code structures are defined as a search patterns and build a Lint-rule set for static code analysis.
