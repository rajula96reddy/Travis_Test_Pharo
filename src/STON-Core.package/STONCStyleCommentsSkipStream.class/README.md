I am STONCStyleCommentsSkipStream, a character ReadStream wrapping another character ReadStream. I skip C style comments, much like a classic C preprocessor.

C, C++, Java, JavaScript style comments are either the multiline

	/* a comment */
	
or the single line, up to end of line

	// a comment 
	
I deal with any end of line convention. Multiline comments cannot be nested. 

You create me #on: another character ReadStream. 

Here is an example:

	(STONCStyleCommentsSkipStream on: 'abc/*comment*/def' readStream) upToEnd.
	
Comments inside single and double quote delimited strings are ignored. Backslash escapes for single and double quotes inside strings are honored.
