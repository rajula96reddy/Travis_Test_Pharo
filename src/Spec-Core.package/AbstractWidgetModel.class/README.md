AbstractBasicWidget is an abstract class for basic widgets

I collaborate with
-  ValueHolder to managed some of my variables.
- ComposableModel to manage me with other elements.

I provide the following variables and their accessors
- enabled is a boolean representing if I am usable or not, it is true by default. It  have also shortcut enable and disable.
- help is the text displayed in the tooltip.
- borderWidth, its default value is 0, it must be called after have displayed the widget. 
- borderColor, its default value is transparent, it must be called after have displayed the widget. 

For the two methods borderWidth and borderColor, notice that some of my subclasses don't display my border

Me and my subclasses provide shortcut hook for my valueHolder, they are named "when" followed of the event.

My drag and drop system don't work well.
