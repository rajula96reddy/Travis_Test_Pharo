I am a group of menu items.

I am part of a menu (MenuModel), and groups items (MenuItemModel) by meaning.

You can also have a look at ApplicationWithToolbar for a full example of how to use them.

I provide the following methods
- addItem: use the block in parameter to initialize a new item, then add it in my collection.
- addMenuItem: add the item in parameter in my collection.
- isEmpty return a boolean representing if my collection is empty.
- menuItems getter of my collection.
