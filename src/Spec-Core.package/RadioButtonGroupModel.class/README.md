I am a group for radio buttons.
See DynamicComposableModel

self example

You can also have a look at MrAndMrsRadioButton and RadioButtonGroupExample for more examples.

I ensures that only one button is activated at the same time and I hold the button activated.

I provide the following variables and their accessors
- buttons is the collection of the buttons I manage.
- currentActivated is the last activated button.

I provide the following methods
- addRadioButton: to add a button in my collection and link it at others.
- default: to activate the button when I am built.
- linkRadioButton: to make the button deselected when another is selected.

defaultOnce: is use to avoid a problem appearing with default: when it is include in other DynamicComposableModel but it should be replace by a fix.

I use the following method for my internal work
- createWidgets assign each button of my collection in my super class collection that manage dynamical subwidgets.
- dynamicLayout refresh the layout using my super class collection.
- rebuildWidget trigger the steps for refresh the widget and the layout.
