I handle one line of text.
See TextModel

self example

You can also have a look at DynamicalPopup for another example.

I handle non source code text, that's why editing shortcuts are not supported (cmd+p just print a p by example).

I provide the following variables and their accessors
- acceptOnCR is a boolean representing if the key cr trigger an accept action,  it is true by default and must be set before built the widget. (if false it will print a cr).
- encrypted is a boolean representing if the text appear like stars (it is only an appearance), beDecrypted and beEncrypted are shortcut to set it.
- entryCompletion is the object used to suggest text while typing, removeEntryCompletion is a shortcut to set it nil.
- ghostText is the ghost text to display in the text zone.

I provide getters of ValueHolder of my super class actionToPerformHolder and textHolder .


todo
- specializing accept:
- specializing eventKeyStrokesForNextFocus , eventKeyStrokesForPreviousFocus
- globalsEntryCompletion
- specializing isCodeCompletionAllowed
