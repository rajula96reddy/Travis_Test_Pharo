I handle basic multi-line text.
See AbstractWidgetModel

self example

You can also have a look at ListSelectionModel and ScrollSyncExample for more examples.

My main purpose is to handle source code (I have editing shortcuts support).

I provide the following variables and their accessors
- autoAccept is a boolean representing if the text is accepted on each keystroke.
- text is the text of the text zone.

I provide the following methods
- beForCode and beForText are shortcut for configuring me.
- getSelection return the interval currently selected.
- getText is a getter of the text
