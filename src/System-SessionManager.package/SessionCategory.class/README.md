A session category allows to define many categories for a session (eg. System, Network, UI and user categories).
It allows session handlers (e.g. classes or packages handlers) to be registered into a category.
By default, the same default priority is assigned to handlers but a specific priority could be specified so that an handler will be activated before/after others.
