I'm workspace: a great place to execute top-level expressions to compute something useful, and it is a great place to develop bits of a program before those bits get put into class methods.

To open a new workspace, execute one of the following expression:

[[[
	self open

	self openContents: '''Pharo is cool'''

	self openLabel: 'A cleaner workspace'
	
	self open label: 'Tutu'
]]]
