I define the collection strategy for the commit: 

- should I commit dirty packages?
- should I commit projects?
- should I include nested projects?

By default, strategy is complete (yes, yes and yes), but users can change if it convinces them.

I'm included in a commit unit and I should not  be accessed outside it.
