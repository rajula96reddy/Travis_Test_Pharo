I am ZnMaximumNumberOfDictionaryEntries.
I am a DynamicVariable and a ProcessSpecificVariable.

I am used to control the maximum number of entries being added to a limited ZnMultiValueDictionary.

Used by ZnMultiValueDictionary and thus for reading headers,  url query and application form url encoded entity fields. This helps to protect us from malicious content.
