I'm the configuration used to load everything needed to perform the bootstrap proces:
- ConfigurationOfPharoBootstrap: the definition of the Pharo packages to bootstrap
- Espell : is basic to run the bootstrap
- Ficus:  is the meta model we use to load the code to bootstrap
- Cargo: the package manager that will give us Monticello definitions for Ficus
